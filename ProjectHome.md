This code was graciously donated by Frédéric Lavigne of lf2prod.com.  The initial check-in was created from a CVS checkout of https://l2fprod.dev.java.net/source/browse/l2fprod/incubator/synthbuilder/.  Some of the classes may have been modified to fit tighter coding standards, such as @Override annotations, etc.
